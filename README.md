# Niva-Mesh-Website
“A resilient mesh communication framework for disaster response – built for India, designed to save lives.”
🚨 About the Project

Niva Mesh is an innovative Business-to-Government (B2G) solution designed to ensure reliable communication and real-time civilian tracking during disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and building collapses.

Conventional mobile and internet networks fail during such crises due to infrastructure damage, congestion, or power outages. Niva Mesh bridges this gap by enabling decentralized communication and real-time location tracking using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) on regular smartphones.
